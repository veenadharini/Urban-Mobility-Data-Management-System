## Objectives
Our project focuses on leveraging data to enhance urban taxi services and traffic management. We aim to:
- Analyze taxi passenger data to determine high and low-traffic times.
- Assess trip frequencies across various payment methods.
- Evaluate the distribution of passengers over time to improve service efficiency.
- Identify congested areas for better taxi dispatching and pickups.
- Optimize payment processing systems for smoother transactions.

## Technologies and Approach
We employed a robust tech stack and methodology:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized MageAI for initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **Data Storage**: Stored processed data in Azure Blob Storage for optimal accessibility.
- **Database Management**: Managed diverse datasets using Azure SQL, incorporating relational, document, and graph data models.
- **Data Pipeline**: Developed automated pipelines in Azure Data Factory for efficient data handling.
- **Visualization**: Created dynamic visualizations in Power BI, focusing on graph data models to present insights.

## Achievements
Through our analysis, we provided actionable insights into:
- Traffic patterns, identifying key times for high and low passenger flow.
- Payment method preferences, suggesting optimizations for transaction processing.
- Service provider performance, offering data-backed recommendations for improvement.

## Future Directions
We're excited to continue evolving our project with plans to:
- Implement real-time data processing for instant insights.
- Integrate user feedback to refine service provider evaluations.
- Explore advanced visualization techniques for deeper traffic pattern understanding.
